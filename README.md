# 1. CONTEXT

The All in One Place is an E-commerce store that sells a variety of products, from different brands and prices. The sales team realized that some customers stood out for the amount spent and the frequency, so they wanted to provide some benefits to these customers to maintain their loyalty. Also, they wanted to know the main characteristics of this group of customers, to understand their influence on the company's revenue.

This group of high value customers are called "Insiders''. To be able to create this group, a clustering model is needed, to group the customers with desirable characteristics, such as high ticket, low recency, high frequency and others.
